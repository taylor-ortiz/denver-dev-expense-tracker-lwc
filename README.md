# Denver Salesforce Developer Group - Salesforce Expense Tracker LWC:

You think to yourself that you wish you had a way to track your expenses so that you can create more visibility into what you are spending. Being proficient in Salesforce as a developer, you decide to build an expense tracker Lightning Web Component that allows you to enter and track your expenses.
